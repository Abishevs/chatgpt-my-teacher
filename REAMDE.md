# ChatGPT my teacher

I asked ChatGPT for exercises. Usualy you would ask it for an answer. With that in mind, you have to specificly declare that you
do not want to have the answer rather just the exercises. ChatGPT can be quite annoying in this regard. He realy wants to be the smart 
guy always...

## My expierience
It's quite instresting to take lessons from him. As you can ask for feedback, it will give to you instatly.
You can ask what could be done diffrently, he is realy good with messaging erros and helping you to build good code. 

So now I usualy ask him for guidance rather than answers directly- with chatgpt 3.5 its even easier :D As he is literly programmed not to give full answers :)
